        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            Formerly a Team Leader in the Billing Department at the Dawn Group of Newspapers, I have recently transitioned full-time into pursuing a career in software engineering. During my time in the media industry, I developed strong leadership, task management, and reporting skills ‚Äî experience I now aim to combine with my growing technical expertise.

I have been actively learning programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JS, TS, Python, C, and C++, and have applied these skills to build personal projects that reflect my commitment to continuous learning and self improvement.

I am especially interested in front-end development and modern web technologies like React and Next.js, with a long-term goal of becoming a full-stack developer. I am also expanding my skillset into artificial intelligence through my current enrollment in the Certified AI Agentic Program under the Governor‚Äôs Initiative in Karachi.

I believe in learning by doing and enjoy building real-world applications that solve meaningful problems. I‚Äôm now seeking opportunities where I can contribute to a software development team, grow in a collaborative environment, and continue to evolve as a professional software engineer.
